# Next-Optimized

This is a Fabric modpack focused on pushing performance to the absolute limit, powered by VulkanMod and a comprehensive suite of modern optimization mods.
By leveraging the power of the Vulkan graphics API in combination with core optimization staples like ModernFix, Lithium, and CCME (Concurrent Chunk Management Engine), this pack is designed to deliver significantly higher frame rates, lower latency, and more consistent frame times compared to vanilla.
It features VulkanBobby to enhance Bobby's extended render distance capabilities, while Entity Culling, FerriteCore, and others work to reduce load on the CPU, GPU, and RAM. While achieving incredible performance, it also retains and enhances the vanilla aesthetic with mods such as Continuity for connected textures and ETF/EMF for improved entity visuals.
This pack is ideal for anyone seeking a smooth, high-FPS experience on lower-end hardware or looking to unlock completely uncapped frame rates on a powerful machine.
**Features:**
*   **Vulkan Rendering:** Replaces OpenGL with VulkanMod for drastically improved rendering efficiency.
*   **Comprehensive Optimization:** Optimizes every aspect, from memory management (FerriteCore) to chunk loading (CCME) and entity rendering (EntityCulling).
*   **Visual Enhancements:** Adds support for connected textures (Continuity) and detailed entity features (ETF/EMF) without a major performance hit.
*   **Useful Utilities:** Includes client-side staples like AppleSkin, Chat Heads, and Bobby for extended view distances.
